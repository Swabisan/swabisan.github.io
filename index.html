                         This was at a hackathon hosted by Rapid.io, they're a database company that was showcasing their new realtime database,
                        which at the time was in closed beta. I had a great time, worked with great people. The project that we were working on was
                        a dashboard that would be able to sort and reapportion objects based on changes in their values. After a multitude of obsticles
                        and pitfalls we were able to get a modest tech demo working, however 24 hour crunch was much more draining than anticipated,
                        it might be a little while until I go to another hackathon!

                    <p>
                         I worked on this sideproject to help me understand the rougher grasps of programming, this is a terminal based java program
                        that emulates the classic boardgame Battleship! I developed the entire thing along with some help from a friend/ mentor who
                        I consulted for advice along the way, this is probably my first full attempt at creating something like this, current this
                        project is pretty messy at it's current state, the current version of the game is fully functional but the maintainability
                        of the code leaves a bit to be desired. Now that I understand some of the finer points of functional programming I would
                        like to rerwite this program. Rewriting Battleship! has been on my to do list for quite some time now.
